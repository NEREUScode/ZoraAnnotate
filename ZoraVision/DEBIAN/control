Description: ZoraVision is a professional annotation tool designed for image segmentation and object detection,

 it has been enhanced with improved usability, additional features, 
 and a refined user interface. The application supports various annotation formats, 
 including COCO-style JSON, YOLO v8, and Pascal VOC, and offers both manual and semi-automated annotation tools, 
 leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM-2) for efficiency. 
 ZoraVision also supports multi-dimensional images such as TIFF stacks and CZI files, 
 providing an optimized user experience with dark mode and adjustable font sizes.
